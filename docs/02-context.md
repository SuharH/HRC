## Context

HRC stores and manages data from all the rooms of the hospital, enabling the viewing and modification of this data in order to monitor and control the status and materials of the rooms.
Data registration happens in RRS.
In this architecture two types of users are defined: viewer and admin. Viewers are only allowed to see the information of the room as the name suggests whereas admins are also allowed to modificate the data.
With the aim of making everything more understable, HRC follows the [C4 model](https://c4model.com) [software system](https://c4model.com/#SystemContextDiagram) diagram.

On the other hand, RRS also has its own context.
