## Roadmap

This document describes the architecture of the Room Control system of a hospital.
It is mainly focused for the HRC (Hospital Room Control) development team but it also can be useful for any other reader that may be interested in the topic.
RRS (Registry of Room Status) is also part of the architecture since it allows data management.
